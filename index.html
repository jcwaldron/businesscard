<!-- ABOUT ME -->
    <section>
      <div>
      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I've always been interested in coding, sofware, and web development. I began making webpages in bare HTML in 1997 and continued through 2003. After education and career changes, I decided to return to it professionally and learn formally.</p>
      <p>I have a great love of puzzles and collaborative problem solving. That makes me an enthusiastic participant in group work. I am also happy when working alone on projects, and enjoy going deep into solving them.</p>
